POE::Component::Client::Ping - an ICMP ping client component

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE qw(Component::Client::Ping);

    Alias       => 'pingthing',   # defaults to 'pinger'
    Timeout     => 10,            # defaults to 1 second

  );

                 $address,    # This is the address we want to ping.
                 $timeout,    # An optional timeout.  It overrides the default.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::Client::Ping is non-blocking ICMP ping client session.
It lets several other sessions ping through it in parallel, and it
lets them continue doing other things while they wait for responses.
Ping client components are not proper objects.  Instead of being
created, as most objects are, they are "spawned" as separate sessions.
To avoid confusion (and hopefully not cause other confusion), they
must be spawned with a C<spawn> method, not created anew with a C<new>
one.

PoCo::Client::Ping's C<spawn> method takes a few named parameters:

=over 2

=item Alias => $session_alias

C<Alias> sets the name by which the session will be known.  If no
alias is given, the component defaults to "pinger".  The alias lets
several sessions interact with resolver components without keeping (or
even knowing) hard references to them.  It is possible to spawn
several Ping components with different names, but the author can find
no point in doing this.

=item Socket => $raw_socket

C<Socket> allows for the caller to open an existing raw socket rather
than letting PoCo::Client::Ping try and open one itself.  This can be
used to let startup code create the socket while running with enhanced
privileges, which are dropped.  People who don't want to audit POE for
security holes will find this useful since they won't need to run POE
as root.

=item Timeout => $ping_timeout

C<Timeout> specifies the default amount of time a Ping component will
wait for an ICMP echo reply.  C<$ping_timeout> contains a real number
indicating how many seconds to wait.  It's possible and meaningful to
set the timeout to a fractional number of seconds.

The default timeout is only used for ping requests that don't include
their own timeouts.

=item OneReply => 0|1

C<OneReply>, if set, tells the Ping component to clear the timeout upon
successful ping.  The Ping component will thus only post one reply back
to the calling module, upon either success or timeout, but not both.
This is useful if you are checking if one host is reachable or not as
you will only receive one reply.  By default, this setting is disabled,
meaning that you will get the ping timeout in addition to any ping 
replies.  This is useful if you are expecting multiple replies from one
ping, such as when pinging a subnet.
 
=back

Sessions communicate asynchronously with PoCo::Client::Ping.  They
post ping requests to it, and it posts responses back.

Requests are posted to the component's "ping" state.  They include the
name of a state to post responses back to, an address to ping, and an
optional amount of time to wait for responses.  The address may be a
numeric dotted quad, a packed inet_aton address, or a host name.  Host
names aren't recommended: they're looked up for every ping request,
and that's slow.  The optional timeout overrides the one set when
C<spawn> is called.

Ping responses come with two list references:

  my ($request_packet, $response_packet) = @_[ARG0, ARG1];

C<$request_packet> contains information about the original request:

  my ($request_address, $request_timeout, $request_time) = @{$request_packet};

=over 2

=item C<$request_address>

This is the original request address.  It matches the address posted
along with the original 'ping' request.

=item C<$request_timeout>

This is the original request timeout.  It's either the one passed with
the 'ping' request or the default timeout set with C<spawn>.

=item C<$request_time>

This is the time that the 'ping' event was received by the Ping
component.  It is a real number based on the current system's time()
epoch.

=back

C<$response_packet> contains information about the ICMP ping response.
There may be multiple responses for a single ping.

  my ($response_address, $roundtrip_time, $reply_time) = @{$response_packet};

=over 2

=item C<$response_address>

This is the address that responded to the ICMP echo request.  It may
be different than C<$request_address>, especially if the request
address was a subnet.

C<$response_address> will be undefined if C<$request_timeout> seconds
have elapsed.  This marks the end of responses for a given request.
Programs can assume that a request address will not send more
responses after this, and they may use the end-of-responses marker to
initiate another ping request.

=item C<$roundtrip_time>

This is the number of seconds that elapsed between the ICMP echo
request's transmission and its corresponding response's receipt.  It's
a real number.

=item C<$reply_time>

This is the time when the ICMP echo response was received.  It is a
real number based on the current system's time() epoch.

=back

If the :const tagset is imported the following constants will be exported:

REQ_ADDRESS, REQ_TIMEOUT, REQ_TIME, REQ_USER_ARGS, RES_ADDRESS, 
RES_ROUNDTRIP, RES_TIME

=head1 SEE ALSO

This component's ICMP ping code was lifted from Net::Ping, which is an
excellent module times when you don't mind pinging single hosts and
only knowing whether they're alive.

See POE, of course, which includes a lot of documentation about how
POE does things.

Also see the test program, t/01_ping.t, in the PoCo::Client::Ping
distribution.
