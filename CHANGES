    Apply Andrew Hoying's (blm.gov) patch to return the response packet's
    time to live (TTL). Update t/01_* to use Test::More. Update t/02_* to
    skip all tests (rather than die) if not run with root privilege.

  t/02_arbitrary_data.t A; MANIFEST M; Ping.pm M

    Chris Williams pointed out that arbitrary data wasn't being passed
    back to users. Events were being split apart from arbitrary data, and
    then just the event was yielded back to the component for retries and
    internal ping queueing. This patch adds a modified test case, fixes
    the bug, and bumps the version to 1.12 for release.

    Apply Michael Costello's suggestion to avoid the root check on
    cygwin. Bump the version for a new release.

    Bump the volume a little more than usual.

    Applied Nick Williams' patch from rt.cpan.org ticket #18337. That's
    almost 1337, but not. Anyway, he's added queuing. It's off by
    default. When enabled, though, the component tries not to spew more
    ICMP requests down the pipe than the operating system can handle. It
    tries to make a guess about opmital parameters, but it's going to be
    inaccurate for lots of people. Nick anticipated this and added
    tunables.
    
    While he was queuing and throttling, Nick also added the option to
    have PoCo::Client::Ping retry a number of times before reporting that
    a host is down.
    
    Since this was a large patch, I took the opportunity to retab and
    restyle the code. 

  2005-06-21 18:27:04 (r41) by rcaputo; MANIFEST M; Makefile.PL M

    Remove META.yml from MANIFEST since it's auto-generated at "make
    dist" time. Have Makefile.PL generate CHANGES with svn-log.perl
    instead of cvs-log.perl.
