    "Jim" on Usenet discovered that the component doesn't clean up after
    a OneReply response. This means the component lingers forever,
    preventing programs from exiting with OneReply enabled. This commit
    fixes that.

    Patch the SYNOPSIS per Ronan Waide's comments. Ideally, we would
    replace them entirely with a sample program.

    Casey Zacek encountered a problem where select_read() would fail on a
    raw socket after a program had dropped its root privileges. His patch
    (applied) keeps the socket open in this case.
