    Bump up the version! 

  2003-11-29 06:55:49 by rcaputo; Ping.pm 1.12; t/01_ping.t 1.6

    Applied Edward Henke's patch to correct a typo (and probably a memory
    leak) in a hash key. Also updated the test program with new ping
    targets, as the old ones seem to all be down for some reason.

    "Jim" on Usenet discovered that the component doesn't clean up after
    a OneReply response. This means the component lingers forever,
    preventing programs from exiting with OneReply enabled. This commit
    fixes that.

    Applied Decklin Foster's patch for a typo in the documentation's
    sample code.

    Patch the SYNOPSIS per Ronan Waide's comments. Ideally, we would
    replace them entirely with a sample program.
