  MANIFEST M; Ping.pm M; t/03_provided_socket.t A

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket 35738. Isaacson rightly pointed out that
    the component would never end if an application gave it its own raw
    socket. Now the component will stop watching the socket when there's
    nothing to do, which will allow it to exit if the rest of the program
    is also stopping. Added a test case for the condition, too.

    Calculate a ballpark optimal Parallelism value by default.
    Previously, the component would try to process as many simultaneous
    requests as possible, often exceeding OS and network limits, and
    either dropping packets or returning responses with patently bogus
    round-trip times. Thanks to Dean Holroyd for rt.cpan.org #48171,
    which this should resolve.
