--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::Ping is an asynchronous, event driven client
for ICMP ping.  It accepts events containing the specifics of ICMP
ping requests, and it returns events carrying the results of those
pings.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires POE.  It also requires root privilege, or your
operating system's equivalent, so that it can open a socket for ICMP
ping.  Knowing what this means, how to achieve it, and the potential
hazards of doing so are left as exercises for the reader.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Client::Ping may be installed through the CPAN shell
in the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Client::Ping'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Client::Ping

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Client::Ping

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::Client::Ping can also be installed manually.
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror should hold the latest
version.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The test program, t/01_ping.t, makes an excellent sample program.  In
fact, it was adapted from the sample program used to debug this
component.  If you would like to see more details about the test's
operation, edit t/01_ping.t and set the DEBUG constant to any value
Perl considers "true".

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
